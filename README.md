# Study Log: 

This repository tracks my daily and weekly study sessions as I build skills in:
- Linux system administration (Ubuntu, homelab projects, security hardening)
- Unreal Engine (C++, Enhanced Input, game systems)
- CompTia A+ Certification

## Goals
- Dedicate 2h30m daily to study/practice
- Complete Linux Journey modules with hands-on homelab implementation
- Progress through Unreal Engine development tutorials and apply concepts
- Obtain my Comptia A+ Certification
- Document daily and weekly progress for accountability

## Structure
- `linux-journey/` → Weekly logs from Linux Journey practice
- `unreal-engine/` → Weekly logs from Unreal Engine practice
