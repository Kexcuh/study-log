Unreal Engine Constructor & Custom Movement Component Notes

	My goal: Replacing the UCharacterMovementComponent in the ACharacter class with custom version.


		FObjectInitializer - UE internal system for creating subobjects (cameras, movement, mesh, etc)
		THIS IS HOW ALL OBJECT IN UNREAL ENGINE ARE INITIALIZED UPON THE GAME STARTING.

			"const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer"

				- I never need to pass this manually, it's automatically injected when spawning objects.


			Default form: 
			
				"ACharacter(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer = FObjectIntializer:Get());"


		Key Thing to remember:


			The base constructor for my custom character class looks like this: 
			
				AMyCharacter()

			To customize the subobjects that are created or in this case specifically the custom movement component, we need to modify it like this:

				AMyCharacter(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer);

			We then input our custom created movement class we will then override the constructor like this:

				AMyCharacter::AMyCharacter(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer) : Super(ObjectInitializer.SetDefaultobjectclass<UMyMovementComponent>(ACharacter::CharacterMovementComponentName));

			I found "CharacterMovementComponentName" in the ACharacter class commented that it can be modified.
			The super here is passing the movement component to the parent (AMyCharacter(const FObjectInitializer& ObjectInitializer)) to then change the movement component object assigned to the character.

			*** INITIALIZATION OF OBJECT HAPPEN BEFORE THE BODY OF THE CONSTRUCTOR RUNS. CONSTRUCTORS CAN ONLY BE INVOKED ONCE PER OBJECT CONSTRUCTION CHAIN.
